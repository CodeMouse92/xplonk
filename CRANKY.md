# THE CRANKY DEVELOPER'S MANIFESTO

We are developing this project for the sole purpose of our own enjoyment.
We make no promises about release date, features, usability, stability,
practicality, or compliance with any normal standards of software
development.

In pursuit of our unhindered enjoyment of this project, the only end-users
we choose to care about in this project are ourselves, and maybe a few select
friends. The timeline, the features, and the implementation are all
solely at our discretion. We reserve the right to make arbitrary decisions, 
and change them at a moment's notice, without owing anyone an explanation.

If you see something here you like, you're welcome to fork the code under
the terms of the LICENSE and do as you wish with it.

If you're still intent on treating this as a viable project, you're welcome
to submit issues and pull requests. We may respond, or we may leave it sitting
indefinitely. If we ignore your bug report or brilliant contribution until
doomsday, don't take it personally.

If you decide to try and *use* this software, you're taking your sanity
into your own hands. As long as it runs on our machines, that is all we care
about. It may be unstable, or not support your system. We offer neither
warranty nor technical support (but welcome bug reports).

We may drop this later and take the project seriously if we ever believe
this to be good enough, but we make no guarantees on if, or when, that may
happen.

Long story short, we're just coding for the love of coding!
