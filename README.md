# XPlonk

An allegedly modern text-based newsreader for USENET. Pronounced "splonk".

## Why?

There are vanishingly few maintained newsreaders for USENET, which nerds like us still love and use. XPlonk is a new newsreader in the old tradition, developed by CodeMouse92 (Jason C. McDonald) and supakeen.

## Tech Stack

* Python 3.7 or up.
* PySide2
* SQLite 3
* ...more later.
