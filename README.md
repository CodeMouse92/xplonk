# XPlonk

An allegedly modern text-based newsreader for USENET. Pronounced "splonk".

## Why?

There are vanishingly few maintained newsreaders for USENET, which nerds like us still love and use. XPlonk is a new newsreader in the old tradition, developed by Jason C. McDonald (CodeMouse92) and Simon de Vlieger (supakeen).
